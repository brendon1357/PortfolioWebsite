# Personal Portfolio Website

Website hosting some of my coding projects. Built with React & Bootstrap.

### Development Notes

NPM used to create production build and handle development locally.

A single-page application, therefore, best initialized with
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```
Load local development server with command
```
npm start
```
Production build not included in repository but can be created with
```
npm run build
```
