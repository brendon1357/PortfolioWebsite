# Personal Portfolio Website

Website hosting some of my coding projects. Built with React & Bootstrap. Website is hosted using Netlify and form submissions are handled 
through Netlify forms.

### Development Notes

NPM used to create production build and handle development locally. If you would like to use my website as a template or starting point
you will need to download and install NPM or Yarn. How to get started with some basic NPM commands is shown below.

A single-page application, therefore, best initialized with.
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
```
cd my-app
```
Start local development server with the following command.
```
npm start
```
Run the following command to create a production build that you should use when deploying the application.
```
npm run build
```
If you plan to use bootstrap and react-bootstrap both can be installed with NPM by typing the following commands in your my-app directory.
```
npm install bootstrap --save
```
```
npm install react-bootstrap --save
```
You can also download React Developer Tools as a google chrome extension to help with debugging.
